There once was a foolish English student in Ms. Pohan's class 
(who always cheated off of the good student Gabriel's work). 
Gabriel was a kind-hearted soul and never told Ms. Pohan of 
Ivan's malificent, plagiarizing actions. Also, Ivan was 
blackmailing him, threatening to reveal to the whole school 
that Gabriel actually did not score an 800 on the SHSAT. Of 
course, Ivan also didn't score an 800, in fact, he actually 
scored a -200 on the SHSAT but committed illicit actions to 
get into Stuyvesant, and has brought this streak of terror to 
school ever since. Only time will tell if the villainous Ivan 
is ever caught and tried for his crimes of high treason 
against the honorable "pro scientia atque sapientia".
